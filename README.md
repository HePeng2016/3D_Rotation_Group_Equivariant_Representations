# Initial
     equivalentFeatures.setN(*N_new*);
*N_new* is the maximum orbital quantum number *l* of the input spherical harmonic representation *Y(lm)*.   
    If this command is missing, then the default maximum orbital quantum number *l* is 3.

   Once this function had been carried out, the tables for the Clebsch Gordan coefficients and the Winger 3j coefficients were generated. And the data structures for storing the relations between coefficients and variables were generated.
# Usage
    equivalentFeatures.CtoS_Encode(*V1*);

  This function changes the cartesian coordination terms to the spherical harmonic coordination terms. 
  *V1* is the vector that records the multipole moment terms of the multipole expansion in the Cartesian system of coordinates.
  The order of the terms in this vector is determined by the length of the term, if the terms are equally long, they are ordered according to the lexicographical order. 
  
  e.g.
  
   *x<y<z*
   *xx<x*
   *xx<xy<xz<yy<yz<zz*
   
*V1* is formatted as: 

N=1: [monopole]

*[1]*
    
N=2: [monopole,dipole]

*[1,x,y,z]*
    
N=3: [monopole,dipole,quadruple]

*[1,x,y,z,xx,xy,xz,yy,yz,zz]*

The output is a spherical harmonic tensor stored as a complex vector.

e.g.

N=2:

*[Y(l=0,m=0),<span style="color: green">Y(l=1,m=-1),Y(l=1,m=0),Y(l=1,m=1)</span>,Y(l=2,m=-2),Y(l=2,m=-1),Y(l=2,m=0),Y(l=2,m=1),Y(l=2,m=2)]*

*Y(l,m)* is the term for spherical multipole moment in the spherical coordinate system. *l* is the orbital quantum number and *m* is the azimuthal quantum number.
